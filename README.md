# FaceKey

In this project, we are securing and optimizing the authentication system on websites by adding an extra layer of security for auto filling the authentication forms by facial detection with liveliness detection feature.

## Problem Statement

For authentication on many websites, it takes a repetitive as well as a tedious task of entering user details which can go from 2 input fields to as many as 4-5 input fields, and if the user saves its password in browser or chooses to stay authenticated then it becomes risky of getting hacked or anyone other than user can access the website without authentication on his credentials, which requires a solution to make this safe as well as an efficient process to login on websites quickly. 

## Solution

For the above problem, we propose a face detection model, which would confirm the identity not just on its facial features but also its liveliness, i.e. is the user present there or if any of his/her photographs are being used for facial recognition? This could be achieved by detecting its eye blink feature, making the overall process much safer than a usual face detection model. 

## Future upgradation

Can be extended to fill in any form, for example: Filling a form for doctor's appointment, or booking a ticket. Through this many long forms could instantly be filled with much accuracy which will potentially reduce errors caused by manual data entry as well as save userâ€™s time and effort. 

It can also be extended for users with disabilities, for example: people with visual impairment can have audio cues as well as head shaking feature for liveliness detection instead of eye blink detection.
